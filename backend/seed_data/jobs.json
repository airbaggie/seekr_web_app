        "description":"**************\n\nIn a nutshell:\n**************\n\nThe IDEO Products team is looking for a Data Scientist to join our San Francisco office. We're looking for a self-starter who can apply data science to the topic of building products for creative teams and work environments and continually learn new things (both technical and non-technical) independently.\n\nThe Data Scientist on the IDEO Products team will partner closely with our Engineers, Researchers, Interaction Designers, and Product Managers. They quickly absorb the scientific and technical content, and can help bridge the team to accessing a deeper level of understanding and feasibility.\n\nIn this role, you will be involved in many parts of the design process and our business: user research, concept development, prototyping, project management, and design stewardship.\n\n*************************************************\nWhy is this role important for IDEO's work?\n*************************************************\n\nIDEO's mission is to create disproportionate positive impact through design. This means getting work to market through trust and strong relationships and through a tactical and human-centered lens on what it will take to launch. The Products team within IDEO is focused on using that human-centered lens to build digital tools that help unlock the power of creativity in organizations, teams, and individuals.\n\nA Data Scientist on the Products team will bring in data-driven thinking and will provide expertise on the positive potential of intersecting data with human-centered product design. A data-driven mindset is critical to scaling our products and measuring our impact.\n\nThe IDEO Products team works on Creative Difference and Shape. Check out some of our work:\n\n\nCreative Difference: ( https://creativedifference.ideo.com/ )We designed a tool to assess an organization's creative competitiveness.\nShape: ( https://www.ideo.com/post/shape )A Visual, Collaborative Space to Build, Test, and Refine Your Ideas\nOI Engine: ( http://oiengine.com/ ) An innovation software product, helping organizations engage their people and networks in creative problem-solving online\nIntercorp ( https://www.ideo.com/case-study/launching-an-innovation-lab-to-benefit-peruvians ): Launching an innovation lab to benefit Peruvians\n\n*******************\n\nOnce here you will:\n*******************\n\n\nPractice data science in a human-centered way, treating data as a richly complex and flexible medium for design\nCollaborate with a diverse product team of product managers, engineers, designers, sales, and marketing to identify the right experiments to test our hypotheses, helping to instrument our products to be able to answer questions, and synthesizing data to support decision-making\nBe generative in helping ask the right questions to help us improve our products and the value they provide\nIdentify and tune algorithms, and work with engineers to launch production-level machine learning systems\nTackle a range of large-scale and complex challenges\nBuild an understanding of the value and dynamics of client organizations\nDive into our products, performing exploratory data analyses, creating plots and interactive data visualizations, implementing various machine learning / statistical / optimization techniques\nHone and improve your data science skills by practicing your craft on our products, researching techniques and methods that are new to you, and applying these new methods in code\nShape the emerging data science discipline across IDEO, by demonstrating what it means for data science to have a disproportionately positive effect on human-centered digital products\n\n*************************\nWhat does IDEO offer you?\n*************************\n\nIDEO is a place unlike any other. It's a place where you can solve complex challenges for our clients or the organization, alongside thoughtful individuals who lead with curiosity, empathy, and optimism. Sure we work hard, but we also intentionally craft moments that allow our community to pause, create, and connect. We encourage our community to bring their whole selves to work, respect the need for work-life balance, and allow for autonomy in the design process and your career.\n\n********************\n\nRelevant experience:\n********************\n\nWe're looking for people who are confident and flexible leaders, with demonstrated experience managing interdisciplinary teams where collaboration is imperative.\n\nWe're looking for people who demonstrate visible experience writing reusable code (likely in Python and/or Ruby) to do exploratory data analysis, simulation, data visualization, and various machine learning and optimization techniques. This could mean a portfolio of open source contributions, personal projects, presentations, or other things that show that you were passionate about a subject, took some initiative to learn about it, and applied it to a real problem.\n\nBeyond the above requirement, our ideal colleague:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIs excited about understanding human and organizational behavior and mindsets, and using data to measure and guide people\nIs interested in or even fluent in design thinking\nIs not afraid to learn something new independently\nLikes using math to solve problems\nContinuously strives to improve on writing and speaking\nIs comfortable with ambiguity and freedom, and can self manage\nIs eager to contribute to our culture of exploration, learning, and diversity of thought\nIs interested in aligning with our values ( https://www.shape.space/ideo/collections/309341 )\nIs fluent with tools/languages like Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, SQL, d3.js, map-reduce, or R; familiarity with Ruby is nice to have\nHas interest and/or experience in digital products (this role is on a product team focused on improving our products, rather than on a consulting project team exploring new domains)\nAble to work with production code and SQL databases to collect data for insights\n\n********************\n\nQuestions about you:\n********************\n\nWhat excites you about applying data science at IDEO?\n\nTell us about a project on which you wrote data analysis code as part of a team. What went well on the project and what would you do differently next time? URLs to examples (slides, reports, apps, code) are encouraged.\nIDEO - \n3 hours ago",
