As the signals approach earth they're bent by relativistic effects, delayed by ionized particles, and refracted by near surface weather resulting in noisy, biased distance estimates which can be used to produce the location of a receiver. The Estimation team is responsible for teasing the signal from the noise, we use physical models for the things we know and statistical models to capture the rest with the goal of producing position estimates two orders of magnitude more precise than traditional GPS.\n\nThe ideal candidate uses words like \"correlation\" and \"posterior\" in daily conversation.
