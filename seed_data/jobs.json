And how do you do this without driving those miles in the real world?\n\nSimulations of course. But here is the tricky part.

        "description":"Who We Are:\n\n\nThe Timelines Infrastructure team is looking for an excellent manager to work on Twitter\u2019s core content delivery platform. Among many things, we own and develop the API and infrastructure that powers the Home Timeline - the core feed of Tweets that our customers interact with every day. In addition, we collaborate with consumer product managers and engineers spanning the client, backend, and relevance parts of our stack, to build platform and infrastructure primitives that support reliable and resilient product features. We build the last stage of the platform before the user experience - by supporting most product development at Twitter we are constantly looking out for patterns to generalize so we can then offer new primitives to easily build products on. These primitives manifest as high scale external public and private APIs, as well as internal APIs and infrastructure that form much of the core product infrastructure for Twitter.\n\n\nExamples of current and past projects:\nThe team builds out the backend for many product changes, for example bookmarking Tweets, and associated CRUD operations on those bookmarked tweets. This product API built on top of the Tweet Collections primitive (user-defined Timelines of tweets), which the team also owns.\nThe team drove the unification and evolution of the backend to client content stream API - \u201cUnified Rich Timelines\u201d (URT) - which cross-cut the Home Timeline, Conversations, Discovery, Search, and Moments surface areas of the product (to name a few). This was a multi-year project, involving a unification proposal and design, a process for evolving this proposal for future product needs, backend support of this new infrastructure, and general support to guide migration across the company.\nThe team built the infrastructure and platform to launch ranking in the home timeline (also called the \u201calgorithmic feed\u201d). This included re-architecting and deploying new services to isolate multiple content source paths with well-defined latency budgets, implementing efficient handling for requesting Tweet features at scale and subsequently consulting deep-learned models for scoring purposes, building out infrastructure to track user state and context per timeline delivery, sourcing candidate tweets from Twitter\u2019s real-time search index, and evolving the home timeline API to pass metadata about what Tweets a user has seen in order to ensure duplicate Tweets aren\u2019t served.\nTo tackle the customer problem of high latencies for \u201ctime to first tweet\u201d around the world, the team worked on adding advanced compression support (Zstandard and Brotli) to Home Timeline JSON responses. This work was later generalized to support all product APIs at Twitter.\n\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do:\nBe the manager of a senior engineering team working on high-impact and challenging products, services, APIs, and libraries that are critical to Twitter\u2019s product strategy and overall site integrity. This role is based primarily in San Francisco, but you\u2019ll have remote team members in Boulder and Austin.\n\n\nWork closely with product and engineering counterparts from teams such as Home Timeline Relevance, Health, Conversations Infrastructure, Search Infrastructure, and Ad Serving, as well as cultivate a strong understanding and relationship with client and machine learning engineers. You will maintain a portfolio of work balancing long and short term objectives, defend the team\u2019s roadmap, and build strong relationships throughout the consumer product organization.\n\n\nMeet regularly with Timelines Infra engineers both in San Francisco and Boulder. Provide timely feedback and mentor and coach engineers with their career growth.\n\n\nAppreciate our collaborative atmosphere. Give and receive feedback to build trust and transparency. Join a team where we #LoveWhereWeWork.\n\n\nWho You Are:\nYou have strong communication skills and don\u2019t mind spending time on video chat as the team is geographically distributed (San Francisco, Boulder, Austin).\n\n\nYou enjoy building camaraderie between engineers and service customers. Twitter\u2019s #OneTeam culture really resonates with your work style.\n\n\nYou are comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity while still driving projects forward. Change feels natural to you and is expected.\n\n\nYou are open and honest and feel as though trust is the best way to build relationships.\n\nYou understand technical design documents and can articulate a system architecture in meetings with stakeholders and technical leads across multiple disciplines.\n\n\nYou work well with multiple organizations such as client engineering, backend services, machine learning & relevance engineering, infrastructure engineering, and consumer product management.\n\n\nYou are skilled at expectation management and are a great advocate for your team.\n\n\nYou are either an existing passionate Twitter, or interested in becoming one. To understand and follow the work of the team, it really does help to be a Twitter user.\n\n\nRequirements\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills.\nStrong technical understanding of design documents and specifications.\nSkilled at building trust-based relationships with the team and fellow technical leaders.\nStrong project management skills.\nMust be able to travel to Boulder Twitter office quarterly to support the team.\nBS, MS, or PhD in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience.\nAdvocate for strong software engineering best practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation).\nGreat sense of humor and ability to build team spirit.\n\n\nWe are committed to an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Twitter is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any legally protected status.",
