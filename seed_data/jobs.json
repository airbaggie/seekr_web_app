And how do you do this without driving those miles in the real world?\n\nSimulations of course. But here is the tricky part.

        "description":"Who We Are:\n\n\nThe Timelines Infrastructure team is looking for an excellent manager to work on Twitter\u2019s core content delivery platform. Among many things, we own and develop the API and infrastructure that powers the Home Timeline - the core feed of Tweets that our customers interact with every day. In addition, we collaborate with consumer product managers and engineers spanning the client, backend, and relevance parts of our stack, to build platform and infrastructure primitives that support reliable and resilient product features. We build the last stage of the platform before the user experience - by supporting most product development at Twitter we are constantly looking out for patterns to generalize so we can then offer new primitives to easily build products on. These primitives manifest as high scale external public and private APIs, as well as internal APIs and infrastructure that form much of the core product infrastructure for Twitter.\n\n\nExamples of current and past projects:\nThe team builds out the backend for many product changes, for example bookmarking Tweets, and associated CRUD operations on those bookmarked tweets. This product API built on top of the Tweet Collections primitive (user-defined Timelines of tweets), which the team also owns.\nThe team drove the unification and evolution of the backend to client content stream API - \u201cUnified Rich Timelines\u201d (URT) - which cross-cut the Home Timeline, Conversations, Discovery, Search, and Moments surface areas of the product (to name a few). This was a multi-year project, involving a unification proposal and design, a process for evolving this proposal for future product needs, backend support of this new infrastructure, and general support to guide migration across the company.\nThe team built the infrastructure and platform to launch ranking in the home timeline (also called the \u201calgorithmic feed\u201d). This included re-architecting and deploying new services to isolate multiple content source paths with well-defined latency budgets, implementing efficient handling for requesting Tweet features at scale and subsequently consulting deep-learned models for scoring purposes, building out infrastructure to track user state and context per timeline delivery, sourcing candidate tweets from Twitter\u2019s real-time search index, and evolving the home timeline API to pass metadata about what Tweets a user has seen in order to ensure duplicate Tweets aren\u2019t served.\nTo tackle the customer problem of high latencies for \u201ctime to first tweet\u201d around the world, the team worked on adding advanced compression support (Zstandard and Brotli) to Home Timeline JSON responses. This work was later generalized to support all product APIs at Twitter.\n\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do:\nBe the manager of a senior engineering team working on high-impact and challenging products, services, APIs, and libraries that are critical to Twitter\u2019s product strategy and overall site integrity. This role is based primarily in San Francisco, but you\u2019ll have remote team members in Boulder and Austin.\n\n\nWork closely with product and engineering counterparts from teams such as Home Timeline Relevance, Health, Conversations Infrastructure, Search Infrastructure, and Ad Serving, as well as cultivate a strong understanding and relationship with client and machine learning engineers. You will maintain a portfolio of work balancing long and short term objectives, defend the team\u2019s roadmap, and build strong relationships throughout the consumer product organization.\n\n\nMeet regularly with Timelines Infra engineers both in San Francisco and Boulder. Provide timely feedback and mentor and coach engineers with their career growth.\n\n\nAppreciate our collaborative atmosphere. Give and receive feedback to build trust and transparency. Join a team where we #LoveWhereWeWork.\n\n\nWho You Are:\nYou have strong communication skills and don\u2019t mind spending time on video chat as the team is geographically distributed (San Francisco, Boulder, Austin).\n\n\nYou enjoy building camaraderie between engineers and service customers. Twitter\u2019s #OneTeam culture really resonates with your work style.\n\n\nYou are comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity while still driving projects forward. Change feels natural to you and is expected.\n\n\nYou are open and honest and feel as though trust is the best way to build relationships.\n\nYou understand technical design documents and can articulate a system architecture in meetings with stakeholders and technical leads across multiple disciplines.\n\n\nYou work well with multiple organizations such as client engineering, backend services, machine learning & relevance engineering, infrastructure engineering, and consumer product management.\n\n\nYou are skilled at expectation management and are a great advocate for your team.\n\n\nYou are either an existing passionate Twitter, or interested in becoming one. To understand and follow the work of the team, it really does help to be a Twitter user.\n\n\nRequirements\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills.\nStrong technical understanding of design documents and specifications.\nSkilled at building trust-based relationships with the team and fellow technical leaders.\nStrong project management skills.\nMust be able to travel to Boulder Twitter office quarterly to support the team.\nBS, MS, or PhD in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience.\nAdvocate for strong software engineering best practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation).\nGreat sense of humor and ability to build team spirit.\n\n\nWe are committed to an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Twitter is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any legally protected status.",

        "description":"Founded in 2015, Honor is now one of the fastest-growing, non-medical home care companies in the U.S. Why? Because we realized that by combining our amazing technology and operations with the local, personal touch of our partner agencies, we could make real progress in transforming this fast-growing, $30BN industry. This unique approach is powering our huge growth - we have cutting-edge machine learning, a beautiful, well-designed app, and industry-leading design, paired with a strong sales, marketing, and support engine.\n\nOur mission and ambitions are huge.

Before I get into the usual job information, I want to share two reasons I\u2019m proud to work here.\n\nA single engineer can make a big difference. From extracting React components for reusability, formalizing CSS naming conventions, adding support for persistence operations to the new microservices framework, implementing infinite scroll\u2026 Countless initiatives with impacts across the entire organization have been thought up, debated, and implemented without red tape.\n\nEven having been through similar sessions at past companies, I found the inclusivity training at Box to be uncommonly poignant and actionable. The people here are genuine in their efforts to welcome everyone and are supported by leadership. And when one of us fails--even accidentally, we call out the marginalizing behavior even if it's uncomfortable to do so.\n\nOkay, here\u2019s the rest:\nBox powers how the world works together.\n\nBox is much more than cloud file storage. We\u2019re building features that enable companies to drive complex workflows from within Box, but that all begins with getting the basic building blocks right. We have openings on two of the teams that are building vital capabilities for the next generation of Box\u2019s product lines: Tasks & Notifications and Personalization\n\nTasks & Notifications : Todo lists, cross-platform push notifications, integration with user-created workflows (think Zapier or IFTTT, but within Box), and more.\n\nPersonalization : Solving \"folder sprawl\" means helping our users find and organize content in a way that suits them, while also not making it harder for others on their team to accomplish their individual goals.\n\nWe\u2019re already the undisputed leader in enterprise file sync and share, so companies store their files and collaborate using Box. These teams are part of an evolution towards moving business processes related to those files inside of Box. It\u2019s all part of our mission to help companies get work done .\n\nAs a Backend Engineer on one of these teams, you will...\n\nBe part of the creative process. Story mapping, design review, meeting with customers and sales, and more\nWrite Java (Spring) at the domain service level to enable the building of UIs across platforms\nInterface with our global-scale data layer that handles complex issues like sharding and caching\nWork with modern cloud technologies like Docker and Kubernetes\nLearn, influence, and adapt in order to work effectively with other teams and groups\nInvest in the growth of your fellow engineers through mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship\n\nWhat are the job requirements?\n\nThis is an onsite role at our headquarters in Redwood City, CA .\nYou should have 2 years of experience doing the following work. (More is fine, a little less might also be fine.)\n\nAdding components to a domain service and defining APIs to expose parts of the service\nImplementing and using monitoring processes to gauge the health and performance of a web application\n\nYour experience does not need to match the specific technologies exactly.\nYou should be able to talk in depth about times during your career when you took initiative.\n\nLearn more about Box Engineering here\n\nImmerse yourself in the Box Platform: Create a developer account at developer.box.com\nBox Engineers share on opensource.box.com\nGet under the hood, comment on your favorite architecture deep-dive at tech.blog.box.com\nGrab a free account and make your content more valuable: Hit us up at box.com\n\nAnd please do take a look at some of the ways we celebrate difference at Box .",

Through our community building tools, we've helped projects like DFINITY and 0x engage developers and crypto enthusiasts. We are backed by top-tier investors, have offices in SF and NY, and are just getting started.\n\nAs an engineer at CoinList you'll find that your days are filled with all sorts of fascinating challenges -- from developing smart contracts, to architecting a high performance exchange, to simplifying the complex to help bring crypto to a mainstream audience. Our work is difficult and ambitious, which is what makes it fun.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneurial person with exceptional engineering talent, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nWho you are\n\n\nYou love to code. You build stuff for fun on nights and weekends. You contribute to open source. You have deep expertise in certain areas (e.g., React) but you consider yourself a generalist and you enjoy learning new platforms.\nYou're really smart. You were a top student in your computer science program or have been teaching yourself programming from an early age. You like being around people who challenge you.\nYou're curious. You want to understand how things work. You value interesting things, especially outside your discipline. You like teaching others and constantly learning. You read and question things.\nYou like to ship. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don't. People know they can count on you to get things done.\nYou're scrappy and entrepreneurial. You've built apps for fun and worked on side projects before. You're interested in all aspects of startups - from user testing, to marketing, to raising capital. If you haven't already started your own company, you think you might like to in the future.\nYou care about the product. You might not be a product expert, but you value good design. You enjoy thinking about why certain products work and discussing new apps. You want to build delightful products that users love and that make people's lives more meaningful.\nYou have good values. You enjoy hanging out with your teammates, make the workplace more fun for everyone, and care about doing the right thing.\nYou are a 10x thinker, far more excited by huge disruptions than by small improvements. If something is hard, that makes it more fun, and you know that if anyone can figure it out, you can.\n\nWhat you will do\n\n\nYou'll contribute in all areas. You might choose to go deep in web development or building open source dev tools to automate our operations, but like your teammates you'll make a habit of working across the stack, frequently picking up new languages and platforms as needed.\nYou'll ship product. From hack days, to experimental prototypes, to developing a new type of auction model, you'll constantly be building and shipping product. You'll write clean, well-documented code, do unit tests, follow best practices, and have the benefit of working in a place where people move fast.\nYou'll rapidly grow and improve. At CoinList you'll be working with some of the smartest engineers you've ever met, who love to learn and teach each other. You'll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, and engrossed in deep conversations on a daily basis.\nYou'll help shape the product. Our whole team cares deeply about the product and has significant input into its development. You'll beta test new prototypes and talk directly with users, and your ideas will always be heard.\nYou'll learn about startups. From fundraising, to recruiting, to negotiating an office lease, you'll learn everything there is to know about growing and running a startup of your own, and we'll do everything we can to connect you with mentors and advisors to help you with your career for years to come.\nYou'll be an owner. We believe in hiring smart people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it's running a critical token sale or leading our work on a new platform, we'll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.\nYou'll create the future. Crypto is a far bigger deal than most people realize, and at CoinList you will be be at the forefront of it. There are all sorts of technical challenges you'll be working though and new questions you'll have to answer, in partnership with founders for the leading crypto projects across the globe. If you're successful, you'll build something the world has never before seen.\n\nAs an early employee at CoinList you will be a critical part of our core team and have a huge influence over the direction of the company.
